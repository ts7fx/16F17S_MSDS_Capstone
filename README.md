## Comparing Unsupervised Learning Approaches on UVA NetFlow Data
	Capstone project for the M.S in Data Science, Fall 2016 - Spring 2017
	
## Instruction
	1. Copy & paste all the data to the "Data" folder. 
	2. Launch the notebook "goodluck.ipynb"
	3. Install libraries required
	4. Run the code to re-produce results on our paper
	5. Check out "Reference Notebooks" folder for more details
	6. Check out "Archive" folder to understand what obstacles we faced for this project
	7. You can always reach out to us for any questions! 

## Data
#### Data Dictionary:
	Source Address: IP address sending packets
	Destination Address: IP address receiving packets
	Source Port: Port used associated with Source Address
	Destination Port: Port used associated with Destination Address
	Bytes: Total amount of data sent
	Packets: Total count of packets
	Duration: Total time of the connection
	Rate: Speed at which the data was transmitted
#### How to get the data:
	See netflow_Instructions.txt 
	
## Repository Structure
#### goodluck.ipynb
	This is the notebook that will produce the results in our paper, given correct data pre-processing step.
	
#### Reference Notebooks: 
	Three draft notebooks we used to produce our final, formal approach.
	
#### Archive: 
	16Fall: past work for Fall 2016 semester
	17Spring: past work for Spring 2017 semester
	Shell: shell script for pre-processing data
	
#### Data:
	Example data with colnames and one entry.
