#Instructions to accessing data
#Purpose: 1) Filter netflow files by static IP; 2) Concatenate 5 min netflow files into one-hour. 
#Will need access to FTP server and SUDO access

#First need to SSH into server

#Paper Data
/home/kmj2ge/sample_netflow/Paper_data

#Concatenated netflow files from 02/13 - 02/17
/home/kmj2ge/sample_netflow



If want to extract new files need to perform following steps:
#1)Create directory to store netflow data
mkdir "feb-12-2017-netflow" (Already created)

#2) Navigate to netflow directory using sudo access
/home/jwc3f/netflow

#3) cp all files associated with day from netflow(We did by hour but can also be done by day)
cp nfcapd.2017021209* /home/kmj2ge/feb-12-2017-netflow (already there)


#4)Navigate to master-parellel script file in kmj2ge directory
cd /home/kmj2ge/scripts

#5)Update scripts by changing file directory to Data_Dir_nfcapd="/home/kmj2ge/feb-12-2017-netflow"
 vim filter-flows-per-nfcapd-master-for-parallel.sh
 vim filter-flows-per-nfcapd-parallel.sh

# Will need to read filter-flows-per-nfcapd-master-for-parallel.sh in detail to understand

#6) Run filter scripts by static IP address on set of files in May-7-2017.
#May need to adjust number of filtered records/xa created in filter scripts depending on how many netflow files your filtering..
#In this example only six are created - FilteredflowRecords1.txt,FilteredflowRecords2.txt, FilteredflowRecords3.txt,....
#The xa are check points created whenever set of filteredFlow records is created

./filter-flows-per-nfcapd-master-for-parallel.sh 2017 02 12 > 2017-02-12-nfcapdlog.txt

Check to make sure file was created in
/home/kmj2ge/flowData/2017-02-12


#7) Change path in concatenate flows script to concatenate each filtered flow record file(This will need to be done for each filteredRecord File. 

vim concatenate-flows-one-day.sh

java -classpath "$Java_Dir" OneDayReports $Record_Dir/filteredFlowRecords1.txt $Flow_Dir > $Flow_Dir/Log_1.txt

time ./concatenate-flows-one-day.sh 2017 02 12 > 2017-02-12-concatenatelog.txt

#8) Navigate to directory with concatenated flows:
/home/kmj2ge/flowData/2017-02-12/concatenated
#ExtGammaFlows.txt are the files you are interested

Change file name  - "concate_Filt1.txt"
#Create new folder outside of current directory to store concatenated file
#Move file to new folder
# store all of the concatenated files for that particular day (and/or day and time).
#our files were concatenated in Python on our local machines.


#For more details see README file in scripts directory
